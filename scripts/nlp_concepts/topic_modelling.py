 Here we have got 2 topics. 0 and 1. Both contains the words which are
    associated with the theme of the doc.
The words are arranged in their order. From left being most
    associated to right being least associated.
Based on the words we can say that Topic 0 is about natural language  processing.
Topic 1 is about LDA method.
